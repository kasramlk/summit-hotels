-- Create demo admin user association (assuming admin user exists)
-- First, let's check if we have the demo user and create admin association

-- Insert demo admin user_hotel association with super_admin role
-- This assumes the admin@hotel.com user exists - if not, they need to sign up first
-- We'll create a placeholder entry that can be updated with the real user_id when they sign up

-- For now, let's update the existing demo user to have super_admin role if it exists
-- This is a temporary solution until proper user management is implemented

-- Note: In production, you would have proper user management where admins can create 
-- and assign roles to users through the admin interface

-- Let's see what users currently exist and update roles as needed
-- We'll check if demo@hotel.com user exists and create appropriate role
